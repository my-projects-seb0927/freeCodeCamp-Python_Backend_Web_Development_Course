## Virtual environments
What if I need a different version of Django for each Django project. And inside of those projects we need some particular packages ~And not in our computer~. We use **Virtual environments**.

A virtual environment it's like a little box where everything your project is stored in. "mini-environment".

### How to create Virtual environments?
1. Install a virtual environment. In this project we are using **Virtual env wrapper**:  
`pip install virtualenvwrapper-win`
> Note from the author: Im going to leave **my steps** because, unfortunately, the tutorial is for windows ~zzz...~. So yeah, I'm using venv. What could possibly go wrong?.  
> So yeah, you alredy have virtual environments. It's called `venv`. Here it's the (https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)[documentation]

2. Create a virtual environment and give it a name:  
`mkvirtualenv [NAME_OF_VIRTUAL_ENVIRONMENT]`
> `python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment]` I reccomend you using sudo... ¿Is that okay? 🤔.

3. Activate the virtual environment: We already did it with the last step. You should see (myapp) in the console
> I didn't: `source <venv>/bin/activate`. You should see (myapp) in the console.
> Btw, the last command is for linux.

4. Now, everithing you write in that command line (`(myapp)`) is going to be in the virtual environment. We are installing Django again.
> The same that the man said. I support it 👍.
